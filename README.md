# Instructions for use

Run tester.py in basics to start the training of a model on mnist.

# Side notes:
This doesn't really have strong frontend stuff or is honestly very useful to anyone except me. Anyways, It's always just been a black box to me, and well, it's still a black box but it's now RGB(1, 1, 1) instead of RGB(0, 0, 0)
I also did part of this project prior to shipwrecked, having written most of the base backprop from scratch library (but the backprop from scratch was extremely buggy so I spent some time fixing it)
