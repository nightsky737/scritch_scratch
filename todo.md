# To do:
Adapt it into something that is more annotated/easier for someone else to understand?
implement cross entropy on jax
run the thing for a couple hours
Code to display img in autodiff check

# Maybe:
fix the topo sort (later)
computational graph size be fluctuating. Why? who knows?
#we just do this on the last batch not even running acc or anything (in both models train loop not saving right metrics)
log softmax
